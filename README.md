# WEB 115 Task Manager Project

This project is my final assignment for WEB 115 and represents a simple but functional task manager built with the core front end stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create an application that lets users add tasks, manage priorities, mark items as important or completed, and remove tasks when they are finished. All task changes are logged in the console as JSON using JSON stringify.  

I built the interface with a clean dark layout that matches my usual SpudStack style. The colors are subtle but modern with orange accents that highlight the elements without becoming distracting. Even with the branding touches the project follows the requirements closely and keeps the structure easy to read and maintain.

### Notes

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation and event driven JavaScript while also giving me a chance to apply my SpudStack style in a clean professional way. The assignment was a good opportunity to build something simple that feels polished and interactive.
